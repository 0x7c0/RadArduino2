#RadArduino2


###use your arduino (due) like a radar
I attach on servos a big antenna for wifi detection, and with RaspberryPi I do many tests. There are some trouble with big servos (choose correct voltage)

_see project (hardware) with fritzing.fzz file @ http://fritzing.org/home/_

========

you must change arduino2 code with your prefer ip address (byte ip[], byte gateway[], ecc), use only a static address.
Afther that, you can access you Radar with any browser, for best user experience i suggest chrome

I use this setting:
